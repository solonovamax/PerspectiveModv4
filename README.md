# A note on Hypixel and this mod

Hypixel recently updated their rules which makes this mod disallowed. 
They have blocked this mod (and every other perspective mod's) modid,
meaning you will be kicked if you attempt to join with it. I am happy
with this decision because it is being fairly enforced (the feature has
been disabled in clients, not just blocked mods), and it is well within
Hypixel's rights to change the rules and take measures to enforce them.
